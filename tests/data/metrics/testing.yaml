  unit: ''
  description: >
    The maximum fraction of magnitudes deviating by more than PA2 from mean (%).

PA2:
  unit: mmag
  description: >
    At most PF1 % of magnitudes may deviate by more than this from the mean
    (millimag).

AM1:
  unit: milliarcsecond
  description: >
    The maximum rms of the astrometric distance distribution for stellar pairs
    with separations of D=5 arcmin (repeatability) (milliarcsec).
